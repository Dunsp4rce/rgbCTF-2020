## Solution
In this question we are given 8 tracks and each track has a random text when inputted in spectogram analyzer.
```
Track 1: 3p}   00:53 
Track 2: jan   5:22 
Track 3: n1y   3:49 
Track 4: OHS   4:32 
Track 5: 4f7   2:21 
Track 6: z_k   3:42 
Track 7: se0   4:00 
Track 8: {ah   4:24
```
I have listed the track length beside each track because I noticed that the gathered text resembles the flag but seems to be jumbled, sort by track length we get, janOHS{ahse0n1yz_k4f73p}. 
Sort by track length was hinted in the prompt, ```time splits``` 

Now that we have janOHS{ahse0n1yz_k4f73p}, it looks like a cipher text of the flag. Now comes the difficult part, finding what cipher it is. It's partially guessy so don't blame yourself if you didn't get it. 

Googling ```Blindfolded Punch-Out world record speedrun``` from the prompt, we need up in this site: [https://www.speedrun.com/mtpo](https://www.speedrun.com/mtpo) , the guy who holds the record is named ```summoningsalt```, which seems to be a key to a cipher. How do i know this? I manually tried to derive rgbCTF from janOHS. 

Vigenere cipher was the closest I could find to derive that. There applying Vigenere decode on janOHS{ahse0n1yz_k4f73p} with the key summoning salt, we get the flag 

## Flag
```
rgbCTF{summ0n1ng_s4l73d}
```
