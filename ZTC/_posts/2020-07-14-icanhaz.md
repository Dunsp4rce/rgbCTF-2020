can u haz a meaningful career in cybersecurity tool development? we hope so!

## Solution
>This is a fun problem which is questioning my career xD. 

The question comes with a icanhaz.xyz file, but using the file command on it we see that it is a xz compressed file. So i changed the extension to xz and extracted it using ``` unxz icanhaz.xz ```
We get a ASCII data file after extracting which is the hex dump of a file.
Now I tried to create a file using the hex dump. I used ```cat icanhaz | awk '{ print $2,$3,$4,$5}' ``` to get the hex values alone from the file.
Then I used this site, [https://tomeko.net/online_tools/hex_to_file.php?lang=en](https://tomeko.net/online_tools/hex_to_file.php?lang=en) to convert the hex dump to file. It seems like we get another xz compressed file from that hex dump.

Extracting the xz file we get a SVG image. This SVG image is interesting cause its just a white image at first, but reading the contents of the image I noticed that Line 4 of the code ```<rect x="0" y="0" width="77" height="77" fill="#ffffff"/>``` is overwriting the fill of all the other rectangles.

Therefore we remove the fill alone from that line and then we get a QR code.

Upon scanning the QR I got the following:
```
/Td6WFoAAATm1rRGAgAhARYAAAB0L+Wj4AbxAN1dAA2XxNFhRNBaOJSxhV08AXoOcZxtalpXU+c+q/ppfZc1/t0z3BU/P16F9jAlXbjrzh5cXk/9vLbc+8NQJ8PNawtALEPD17f25zdggODx3xzNLY3SjGTIlX0fbqo6HFkHYkIzOjjUgJcN1KbzGRouW+G8TakjrJ4y5Pk7jv/stqRiV0ICPYxKpnZSEn0aLzQSl46j6H3BBUBhRuGgxue3TXIzw5HGMlchgNBs6SCfHU0SkX4zlSKqOWSyKrJ5JMgwC47en2kI68/tRNQYaYzvGGcWcR/iEgNYO/jHVDVLAAAAADjqmgxrEIjCAAH5AfINAADD+B/oscRn+wIAAAAABFla
```
This looks like a Base 64 encoding, so I Base 64 decoded which gave another xz file. Decompressing the obtained xz file gave another QR ```I know they are obsessed with QRs xD```
The exact command to base64 decode and decompress:
```
echo /Td6WFoAAATm1rRGAgAhARYAAAB0L+Wj4AbxAN1dAA2XxNFhRNBaOJSxhV08AXoOcZxtalpXU+c+q/ppfZc1/t0z3BU/P16F9jAlXbjrzh5cXk/9vLbc+8NQJ8PNawtALEPD17f25zdggODx3xzNLY3SjGTIlX0fbqo6HFkHYkIzOjjUgJcN1KbzGRouW+G8TakjrJ4y5Pk7jv/stqRiV0ICPYxKpnZSEn0aLzQSl46j6H3BBUBhRuGgxue3TXIzw5HGMlchgNBs6SCfHU0SkX4zlSKqOWSyKrJ5JMgwC47en2kI68/tRNQYaYzvGGcWcR/iEgNYO/jHVDVLAAAAADjqmgxrEIjCAAH5AfINAADD+B/oscRn+wIAAAAABFla | base64 -d | xz --decompress
```
Scanning the QR code gives us the flag.
