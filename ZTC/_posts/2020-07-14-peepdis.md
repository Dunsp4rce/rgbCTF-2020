Do you peep what I peep?

**Files**
- [peepdis.dae]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/peepdis/peepdis.dae)

## Solution
We get a peepdis.dae file to work with which seems like a file used for graphic designing. I found an online dae file viewer, [https://www.creators3d.com/online-viewer](https://www.creators3d.com/online-viewer) 
After importing the dae file, i reduced the exposure to zero and toggled on the x-ray option which gave a QR code:

Scanning the QR code, we get the flag. 

## Flag
```
rgbCTF{3d-1337!}
