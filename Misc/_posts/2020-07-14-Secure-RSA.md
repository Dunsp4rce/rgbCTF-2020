We have created the securest possible RSA algorithm! (Put your flag in the flag format.)

## Solution

This ended up being a troll question that surprisingly not many teams solved. Clearly, the numbers themselves were nonsense, but the lack of special characters, along with the fact that the description was unnaturally wordy, led me to casually check the first characters of each sentence (especially since two of them were `3` and `0`, rather common `1337` characters). Sure enough, it spelt out `ST3GL0LS`, which was the flag.

## Flag

`rgbCTF{ST3GL0LS}`
